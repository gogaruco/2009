            Cheap and convenient, though not your swankiest place.  Beck's is an economy style motel with rooms that open onto outdoor
            walkways overlooking the parking lot.  Street noise may be an issue, and the weekend guests can be a bit festive.  On the
            other hand, it's a two-minute walk to the conference hall and there are lots of good places to eat nearby.

            This Holiday Inn is a good mid-range hotel. It's right next to the Civic Center MUNI/BART station, and just a
            short subway ride to the conference hall.  Also easy to get to from SFO or OAK airports on BART.
            Not much interesting nearby, but that's what MUNI is for.

            Located in San Francisco's Union Square, the Grand Hyatt is a full-service hotel with all the amenities.
            It's a 3-4 block walk to the Powell Street MUNI/BART station, so still fairly convenient for travel
            to/from the conference hall and airport BART.  This is tourist-central San Francisco so there's dining
            and shopping galore, and Chinatown is just a few blocks away.

<h2>Public Transit</h2>
<p>A quick primer on SF transit for those not familar with it.  There are two main public transit systems: <a href="http://www.sfmta.com/cms/mhome/home50.htm">MUNI, which operates busses, streetcars and the subway within the City,</a> and <a href="http://bart.gov/">BART</a>, which provides lightrail for the City, the upper peninsula, and the East Bay.  You can take BART from either SFO or the Oakland airport into the City.</p>

<p>The conference hall is convenient to all the major MUNI subway/train lines, but if you're coming into the city on BART you'll have to transfer to MUNI in one of the stations between Embarcadero and Civic Center.  Protip: during afternoon rush hour, transfer from BART to MUNI at Embarcadero or Montgomery station to get on an empty MUNI train; they can fill up quickly.</p>

<h2>Parking</h2>
<p>
  Parking in the Castro is not great.  Daytime street parking on weekdays is either metered or requires a resident permit.
  There are a couple of local lots we are talking to about reserving spots.  We highly encourage taking transit or carpooling.
  Nevertheless,  we'll be providing more information about parking soon.
