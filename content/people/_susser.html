  <h4>Josh Susser</h4>
  <p>Josh likes to say that Ruby is the love child of Lisp and Smalltalk, raised by Perl the eccentric nanny. At Pivotal Labs he spends most of his time developing Rails web applications for clients, and he is a frequent contributor to the Rails open source project. He has spoken at <a href="http://railsconf.org/">RailsConf</a>, regional conferences and meetups. You can find his blog at <a href="http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/">blog.hasmanythrough.com</a>.</p>
