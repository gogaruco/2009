  <h4>Ruby Proxies for Scale, Performance, and Monitoring</h4>
  <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers/grigorik.html">Ilya Grigorik</a></p>

  <p>A high-performance proxy server is less than a hundred lines of Ruby code and it is an indispensable tool for anyone who knows how to use it. In this session we will first walk through the basics of event-driven architectures and high-performance network programming in Ruby using the <a href="http://rubyeventmachine.com/">EventMachine</a> framework. Then we will dissect two real-world examples of Ruby proxies and their applications:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Performance A/B Testing: duplicating live traffic against multiple servers to compare speed, reliability and format of the response.</li>
    <li>Extending protocols: intercept packets and inject your own functionality into applications such as Memcache, Beanstalkd, and others.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No prior knowledge of EventMachine will be assumed. Rudimentary knowledge of network programming will be helpful.</p>
