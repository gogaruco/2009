    Just as Rails did for web development, the Arduino project combines powerful layers of abstraction with sensible defaults, making it easy to build hardware devices that sense and manipulate the physical world. So easy that artists, social workers, scientists, and even simple web programmers who lack electrical engineering degrees can do it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Ruby Arduino Development project attempts to extend these virtues by bringing the beauty and power of Ruby to the Arduino platform. RAD compiles Ruby scripts for execution on the Arduino microcontroller development board. In addition to the syntactic elegance and simplicity gained by getting to program in Ruby instead of C++, RAD provides a set of declarative Rails-like conventions and helpers that reduce boilerplate and simplify often-byzantine hardware APIs.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this talk, I'll provide a whirlwind introduction to the world of hardware hacking and demonstrate a number of projects that use RAD to integrate hardware with other well-known Ruby projects including Sinatra, Shoes, and Archaeopteryx. Ever wanted a bell to ring when you push code to GitHub? Ever wanted your artificially intelligent DJ to be able to play real drums? If so, this is the talk for you.

  <h3><a name="elliott">Using Shoes to create better iPhone apps</a></h3>
  <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers/index.html#elliott">Tim Elliott</a></p>

  <p>
    Shoes is a tiny graphics toolkit that embeds ruby. It allows you to do
    anything. You can draw squares and circles and they can move about and
    say "Good Morning" when they chance upon each other. Shoes lets you
    add layouts to your applications with ease. It borrows ideas from
    Processing, Lua, and HTML to make an intuitive language to convert
    your ideas into programs that you can share with your friends.
  </p>
  <p>
    This talk begins with a Shoes introduction for Ruby programmers. It
    won't take much to get up and running and we can move straight into a
    practical application of Shoes: prototyping iPhone apps. It turns out
    Shoes is excellent for quickly implementing ideas, testing workflow,
    and fleshing out the code structure. It's nice to do this stuff in
    Ruby first before porting it to Objective-C.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will also cover how to debug shoes applications and a look into the
    Shoes source code.

  <h3><a name="grigorik">Ruby Proxies for Scale, Performance, and Monitoring</a></h3>
  <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers/index.html#grigorik">Ilya Grigorik</a></p>

  <p>A high-performance proxy server is less than a hundred lines of Ruby code and it is an indispensable tool for anyone who knows how to use it. In this session we will first walk through the basics of event-driven architectures and high-performance network programming in Ruby using the <a href="http://rubyeventmachine.com/">EventMachine</a> framework. Then we will dissect two real-world examples of Ruby proxies and their applications:</p>
  <ul class="dots">
    <li>Performance A/B Testing: duplicating live traffic against multiple servers to
      compare speed, reliability and format of the response.</li>
    <li>Extending protocols: intercept packets and inject your own functionality into
      applications such as Memcache, Beanstalkd, and others.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No prior knowledge of EventMachine will be assumed. Rudimentary knowledge of network programming will be helpful.</p>
