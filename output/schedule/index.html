<h2><a name="about"></a>About Our Technical Program</h2>
<p>Creating a technical program for a conference involves juggling a lot of different and potentially conflicting goals. We want to have the best program possible, but what does that mean? We want to be completely open about our goals and our process, and to let you know how you can participate.</p>

<p>We have two main goals in terms of who should present. First, we want to serve local residents who don't get to travel to conferences in other cities, so we decided to bring in speakers from all over who would be of interest to locals. Next, we want to take advantage of all the amazing local talent, and let visitors see just why the Bay Area rocks so hard.  That means a mix of local and, um, global speakers.</p>

<p>We also feel it is time to try something different from the seemingly standard process of having an early call for proposals, followed by a lengthy review and selection by a few people behind closed doors.  That works well for a lot of conferences, but this is San Francisco, after all.  So we are constructing the program as a mix of invited talks and attendee-selected talks.  Without waiting for proposals, we have gone out and invited a lot of great speakers to give you a solid core program.  This lets us use our own editorial bias on what we think is worth talking about.  But we also want to hear about new stuff, stuff we aren't aware of, and stuff you have your own interest in.  So we're reserving roughly half the program for talks to be selected by attendee voting.</p>

<p>Sometime in mid-February we'll be opening a web site where anyone can propose a talk. We'll be moderating proposals, and working with submitters to make sure the talk is appropriately targeted for the audience and conference theme. Then registered attendees will be able to vote on the talks they want to see. This gives you a say in the content of the program, and it gives presenters enough lead time to prepare good talks.  We'll have more details on this process and system soon.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you want to present at the conference we certainly don't mind hearing from you, but we won't be making any decisions about adding more talks to the program until the voting system is in place and attendees have made their selections.  We still have a few invited talks we're waiting for descriptions of, so you'll see additions to the schedule as those trickle in.</p>

    Many of us discovered Ruby because of Rails, but there are many more frameworks for both web development and other application domains. We have assembled authors and contributors from six of the major application frameworks written in Ruby: Rails, Merb, Sinatra, Adhearsion, RAD and Shoes.  We'll get to hear what they have to say about what makes Ruby good (or bad) for building frameworks, and what opinions they have of other frameworks.  Come with your questions, and demand answers!

  <h3><a name="borenstein"></a>Arduino is Rails for hardware hacking</h3>
  <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers/index.html#borenstein">Greg Borenstein</a></p>
  <p>
    Just as Rails did for web development, the Arduino project combines powerful layers of abstraction with sensible defaults, making it easy to build hardware devices that sense and manipulate the physical world. So easy that artists, social workers, scientists, and even simple web programmers who lack electrical engineering degrees can do it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Ruby Arduino Development project attempts to extend these virtues by bringing the beauty and power of Ruby to the Arduino platform. RAD compiles Ruby scripts for execution on the Arduino microcontroller development board. In addition to the syntactic elegance and simplicity gained by getting to program in Ruby instead of C++, RAD provides a set of declarative Rails-like conventions and helpers that reduce boilerplate and simplify often-byzantine hardware APIs.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this talk, I'll provide a whirlwind introduction to the world of hardware hacking and demonstrate a number of projects that use RAD to integrate hardware with other well-known Ruby projects including Sinatra, Shoes, and Archaeopteryx. Ever wanted a bell to ring when you push code to GitHub? Ever wanted your artificially intelligent DJ to be able to play real drums? If so, this is the talk for you.

  <h3><a name="elliott"></a>Using Shoes to create better iPhone apps</h3>
  <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers/index.html#elliott">Tim Elliott</a></p>

  <p>
    Shoes is a tiny graphics toolkit that embeds ruby. It allows you to do
    anything. You can draw squares and circles and they can move about and
    say "Good Morning" when they chance upon each other. Shoes lets you
    add layouts to your applications with ease. It borrows ideas from
    Processing, Lua, and HTML to make an intuitive language to convert
    your ideas into programs that you can share with your friends.
  </p>
  <p>
    This talk begins with a Shoes introduction for Ruby programmers. It
    won't take much to get up and running and we can move straight into a
    practical application of Shoes: prototyping iPhone apps. It turns out
    Shoes is excellent for quickly implementing ideas, testing workflow,
    and fleshing out the code structure. It's nice to do this stuff in
    Ruby first before porting it to Objective-C.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will also cover how to debug shoes applications and a look into the
    Shoes source code.

  <h3><a name="grigorik"></a>Ruby Proxies for Scale, Performance, and Monitoring</h3>
  <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers/index.html#grigorik">Ilya Grigorik</a></p>

  <p>A high-performance proxy server is less than a hundred lines of Ruby code and it is an indispensable tool for anyone who knows how to use it. In this session we will first walk through the basics of event-driven architectures and high-performance network programming in Ruby using the <a href="http://rubyeventmachine.com/">EventMachine</a> framework. Then we will dissect two real-world examples of Ruby proxies and their applications:</p>
  <ul class="dots">
    <li>Performance A/B Testing: duplicating live traffic against multiple servers to
      compare speed, reliability and format of the response.</li>
    <li>Extending protocols: intercept packets and inject your own functionality into
      applications such as Memcache, Beanstalkd, and others.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No prior knowledge of EventMachine will be assumed. Rudimentary knowledge of network programming will be helpful.</p>

  <h3><a name="kallen"></a>Magic Scaling Sprinkles</h3>
  <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers/index.html#kallen">Nick Kallen</a></p>
  <p>Building a massively scaled, fault tolerant web service isn't easy, but it's definitely easier if you know which architectures work and which don't. In this talk we'll survey the architecture and complexities of a scalable web service including edgeware, middleware, message systems, load balancing, cache hierarchies, queueing theory, coordination primitives for distributed computation, designing for latency, inter-process communication, load balancing versus locality, write versus read throughput, non-relational datastores, database replication topologies, logging distributed computations, fault tolerance, deployment at scale, forensics, and the merits of suicide.</p>

  <h3><a name="kilmer"></a>MacRuby and HotCocoa</h3>
  <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers/index.html#kilmer">Rich Kilmer</a></p>
  <p>
    MacRuby is an implementation of the Ruby language that runs on the Objective-C runtime under OS X.  MacRuby is based on Ruby 1.9 but contains substantial modifications including the merging of object models (every Object is an NSObject), using the Objective-C 2.0 generational garbage collector, moving core types (String, Fixnum, Array, Hash) atop their Objective-C counterparts and replacement of standard libraries to more optimally integrate with OS X.  MacRuby also includes a new library, HotCocoa. HotCocoa is a thin, idiomatic Ruby layer that sits above Cocoa and other frameworks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cocoa classes have extremely verbose method and constant names. A substantial amount of code is written to just instantiate and configure instances of these classes. Interface Builder is used by most developers because it hides the complexity of manually configuring controls, but at the expense have having to use a GUI builder and the obscuring those configuration options inside the IB user interface. One of HotCocoa's chief goals is to allow Interface Builder simplicity, but in Ruby code.  Buttons, Sliders, Windows, WebViews&mdash;the whole works&mdash;HotCocoa simplifies this process by creating a mapping layer over the top of Objective-C classes. HotCocoa adds Ruby-friendly methods, constants and delegation techniques that look refreshingly simple, but do not prevent full use of the Cocoa APIs.
  </p>
  <p>
    This talk with introduce MacRuby and HotCocoa and show demonstrations on how to use them to quickly build OS X desktop applications with Ruby.

  <h3><a name="sobo"></a>Unison: A Relational Modeling Framework</h3>
  <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers/index.html#sobo">Nathan Sobo</a></p>
  <p>
    The relational model has long been the domain of databases, but hidden beneath the awkward, non-compositional syntax of SQL lies the relational algebra, an elegant and compact formalism with powerful implications for distributed application design. Because relational models don't rely on pointers and complex object graphs, it's easy to work with them across network boundaries. All data can be represented as sets of scalar-valued tuples, which are easy to encode in JSON, and all model operations can be expressed in terms of create, update, and destroy, which are compatible with REST.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this talk, I'll introduce two symbiotic libraries that leverage these properties to enable elegant client/server web applications. On the server, there's Unison, with an API similar to ActiveRecord's, but more general. In addition to has_many and friends, Unison adds relates_to_many and relates_to_one, allowing custom associations to be constructed through the composition of relational operators. For the browser, I'll introduce June, which offers a JavaScript version of the same API, along with a relational object-store, and I'll demonstrate how June clients can securely pull arbitrary datasets from a Unison-based server, treating it like a relational database. We'll also explore the nexus of the relational model with event-driven programming and the actor model of concurrent computation.
